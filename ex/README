The files in this directory are sample applications (other than the
changelog2x script) and sample CSS stylesheets that can be used with
the XHTML output styles.

The changelog2x script allows two CSS files to be specified (not counting
the open-ended 'headcontent' or 'headcontentfile' command-line parameters).
The main one, specified with the '--css' option, is assumed to be general
styling, fonts, spacing, etc. The second, specified via '--color', can be
used to select a color-scheme defined using the same class names and applied
via the cascade mode.


FILES:

changelogml.css
    This is a basic set of styles for the XHTML content, with no colors
    explicitly specified. It sets up fonts, spacing, etc. The fonts preference
    is for the Deja Vu Sans family, falling back to Bitstream Vera Sans,
    Helvetica, then finally Arial. No specific font is given for fixed-width
    text in the filenames, but the table-of-contents links are styled to use
    Deja Vu Sans Mono, falling back to Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, Courier New
    and finally monospace. The <ul> containers used for listing filenames have
    the <li> tags styled to use the "Â»" character in place of the traditional
    bullet.

black-white.css
    This is a very short set of styles that augment the above sheet by
    specifying a black-text-on-white color scheme. All other colors are
    grey-tones (the annotation of file actions and the hover-color over
    hyperlinks). Lastly, a hovor-color is set for the release-container to
    highlight it with a slightly darker background.
