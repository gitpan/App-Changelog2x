App::Changelog2x - Utilities to transform ChangeLogML using Perl

Version: 0.10

WHAT IS IT

This package is a sample application using Perl, that transforms project
change-log data written as ChangeLogML into various types of output. It
can produce clean XHTML output, as well as plain-text that closely resembles
traditional "Changes" files.


USING App::Changelog2x

See the docs for the changelog2x script that is installed along with the
module.


BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package provides a Makefile.PL file as is typical of CPAN modules.
Building and installing is as easy as:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        # If tests pass
        make install

(The "make install" step may require super-user privileges.)


PROBLEMS/BUG REPORTS

Problems, bug reports, or suggestions for enhancements can be sent directly

up for all CPAN-based distributions:
